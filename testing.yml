    description: This table contains a variety of data types, including arrays, structs,
      and primitive types. It is designed to accommodate complex data structures and    
      can be used for scenarios such as data transformation, analysis of nested data,   
      and handling diverse data inputs. Use cases may include processing uploaded       
      files, analyzing user-generated content, or managing complex datasets that require
      flexible data representation.
